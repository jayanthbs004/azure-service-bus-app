This Java application demonstrates the basic usage of Azure Service Bus, a fully managed enterprise message broker. The application will perform the following tasks:

Send Messages to a Queue: The application will send messages to an Azure Service Bus queue. This simulates a producer that generates messages to be processed.

Receive Messages from a Queue: The application will receive messages from the Azure Service Bus queue. This simulates a consumer that processes messages.

Detailed Steps:
Setup Azure Service Bus:

Create an Azure Service Bus namespace in the Azure portal.
Create a queue within the namespace.
Obtain the connection string for the namespace.
Configure the Application:

Use the connection string in the application to connect to the Azure Service Bus.
Define the queue name in the application properties.
Send Messages:

Implement a producer class that sends messages to the queue.
Use the Azure Service Bus SDK to send messages.
Receive Messages:

Implement a consumer class that receives messages from the queue.
Use the Azure Service Bus SDK to receive and process messages.
